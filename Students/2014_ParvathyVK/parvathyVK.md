## Works

The works mainly includes academic works done during B.Arch and the current works at CEPT. 

Few installations were developed as part of **Winter School Program**. Some installations were generated through Rhinoceros and Grasshopper. 

Here are the hand made model of the same:
 
* **Seat and Pavillion combined**: An installation on ground which is a seat that transforms itself into a pavillion
