Markdown (```.md``` or ```.markdown```) is a *human-readable* text format that is easily turned into (not-so-readable) HTML.  **It is super easy to learn and is used all over the place.**

## learn some Markdown, tell about yourself

So, I want to learn about you, and you [obviously] want to learn some Markdown -- the only solution is this assignment!

For this assignment, you are going to make a very simple Markdown file that will be later uploaded (as HTML) onto the class website.  This file will be filled with information about you, so that I and the rest of the class can really get to know one another.

*There will be some information that will be taken out of the version that will go on the website.  Of course, if there is anything in particular that you do not wished shared with the world, please let me know*

### Instructions

1. In the class Google Drive Folder, make a folder (also known as a "directory") named: ```2014_FirstnameLastname``` -- your first and last name should be capitalized (and there is no space between the two)
2. In the folder, make a Markdown file with the same name (```firstnameLastname.md```) and fill it out using the template below.
3. If there are any images put the images in the same file (and make sure that the is not much more than 200kb).
4. Submit a final version by **24:00 IST - Sunday, 27 July, 2014.**

### Format

Here is ~~a sample~~ my version.  Please use it (and feel free to change it... just make sure yours conveys the same information).
