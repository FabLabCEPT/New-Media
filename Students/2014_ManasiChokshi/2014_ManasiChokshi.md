    Even though am born and brought up in Mumbai, I am originally from Ahmedabad. My Grandparents and father are brought up in the pol-Lakhapatel ni pol. Something am really proud about.
    I love reading about Indian mythology,history, bits and pieces of spirituality, architecture.
    I just visited my brothers and cousins in the united states of america. I saw cities of Chicago, NYC, Washington DC, San Francisco, Boston, Pennsylvania.
