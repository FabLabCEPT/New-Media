*Computational Desgin*: modern, organic, complex; or so we are told.  

Computational design is nothing new, it has been around for centuries, if not as long as there were designers.  Simply put, and in this faculty member's humble opinion, computational design is where *design* meets *everything else*. Other than that, it defies definition for it so many things at any one time.

This course will be a conversation as well as a workshop which will cover some of the many topics and areas of study within computational design.  The goal is for students to develop an in-deapth understanding of the underlying concepts in this field, thus it will focus on theoretical issues, but will anchor these with hands-on activities and assignments.  One area of particular area of study will be *dia_logue systems*; these will be un-packed and discussed in depth.

## Assignments and Expectations

> For policies regarding assignments, please see the [Policies section below](#policies).

There will be two types of assignments given out in this class.  **All are mandentory and due dates are strict to ensure proper credit is due.**

###### Weekly Assignments

These will be a combination of short readings and small projects that *will require work outside of class*.  They are formulated so that you will be able to accomplish them with the help of FabLab CEPT and other local resources.  
**Due one week from assigned date.**  

###### Projects

These are multi-week assignments that will culminate in either a final or mid-term.  Students will have to self-pace for proper completion of the assignment.  
**Due-date notified at time of assignment.**

---

## Policies, et al.

### Attendance & Due Dates

Attendance to *all lectures* is mandatory.  

Of course, if there are circumstances that dictate, absence is acceptable if:

1. Prior notice is given **by the student him/her-self**.

2. Total number of absences throughout the semester is *reasonable* (as decided by faculty).

Submissions for work will be strict, though exceptions are possible - they will be granted according to the same criteria above.

### Grading

**All students** are expected to contribute towards the class whether or not they are receiving a final grade toward their GPA or receiving a P/F.  The final make-up of the grade will be decided by the faculty.

##### Grading will be based on:

* **Participation**: This is more than just attendance, this includes active interaction in discussions and group work.

* **Quality of work & process**: Showing a successful design process (which culminates in fine work) is the standard.

* **Attendance & Due Dates**: Attendance and submissions will be recorded and will be used in grading.

##### A note on group work

Group work is a basic part of life and grading is comprised of two parts: **the individual** and **the group**.  Each is assessed based on both the ideal (ex. the quality of the work) as well as the mitigating circumstances (ex. group dynamic/abiliteis).  *Weight will be given toward the quality of the group work.*

In the end, group work will be successful if every group member does to the best of *their own abilities*.  This **does not** mean that all work will be split equally, it means that **the work** has to get done, somehow, someway.

### Academic Integrity

The purpose of education is promote and expand the truth.  Collaboration and building off the work of others are, of course, the corner-stones of academic research, but must be used with integrity.  Thus, all work must be presented with *honesty* as the foundational criterion.

Students must:

* Appropriately cite any and all work (papers, images, videos, etc.) that contributed toward their work.

* Properly acknowledge collaboration (of any type) that contributed toward their work.

* Request information from faculty regarding questions before submission of work.

Any act of plagiarism, cheating, or other act of academic dishonesty will be addressed on a case-by-case basis, but may be considered a serious offense.

Any questions about citation, research, or those in regards to this policy should be referred to ```fablab@cept.ac.in```.

*This policy is heavily influenced by those of MIT (Cambridge, MA).  For more information see ```integrity.mit.edu```.*

### Code of Conduct

All students (and others) are required to treat themselves, those around them, their environment with the upmost respect.  Discrimination, harassment, violance, etc. of any kind, is unacceptable and **will be handled with all seriousness**.  

Any questions in regards to this policy should be referred to ```fablab@cept.ac.in```.
